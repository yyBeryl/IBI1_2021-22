#a is the number of points in the triangle
#b is the added number of points each time
#a=1
#b=1
#b=b+1
#a+=b by doing this I can get the number of points each time 
#print(a)
#repeat for b in range(1,11) so I can get ten statistics
	#run
	#Is b out of range?
	#	If less than 10:Keep running
	#	If 10:DONE!
a=1
b=1
while 1==1:
	print(a)
	b=b+1
	a+=b
	if b==11:
		break
