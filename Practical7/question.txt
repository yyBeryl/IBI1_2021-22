Quesion: How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?
question line number: 50
discussion: It is just what I expected.
	The coincidence of these two lines at first means that there were zero new cases in Spain during this period.
	The total cases went up continuously later was because there always had new cases adding to.
